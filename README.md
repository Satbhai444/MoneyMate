An AI-powered Telegram bot landing page that enables lightning-fast expense tracking and ledger management directly from your chat.

## Overview
Money Mate revolutionizes personal finance tracking by eliminating the need for complex apps. Built entirely on Telegram, it acts as your personal AI accountant. Simply chat naturally—send text or voice notes—and Money Mate will parse the intent, categorize the transaction, and manage your ledgers in real-time.

This repository contains the sleek, highly interactive, and responsive frontend landing page for the Money Mate platform, featuring Apple-style Bento Grids, hyper-realistic iPhone mockups, and scroll-triggered animations with haptic feedback.

## Features ✨
- **Hyper-Realistic iPhone Mockup:** Fully interactive hardware buttons (Power, Volume HUD, Silent Switch dropdown) built purely with CSS and JS.
- **Scroll-triggered Haptic Feedback:** Uses the Web Vibration API (after the first user interaction, as browsers require) on supported devices.
- **Interactive Parsing Demo:** Type an expense in Hindi, Hinglish or English and watch an in-browser preview parse the intent, amount (₹, commas, `k`/`lakh`), category and people. Press Enter, `/` to focus, or tap an example chip.
- **How it works + QR code:** 3-step onboarding and a scannable QR for desktop visitors.
- **Mobile-first navigation:** Accessible hamburger menu on every page.
- **SEO ready:** Unique meta per page, absolute Open Graph images, JSON-LD (SoftwareApplication + FAQPage), `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`.
- **Accessible:** Skip link, keyboard focus styles, ARIA labels, `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- **Zero Dependencies:** Built with pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
